## Why MediaFlow

MediaFlow is a local-first desktop app built for high-volume subtitle and track workflows.
It combines FFmpeg-powered media processing with AI-assisted tools in one interface.

## Tools

### 1. Extraction
- Scan media containers and inspect tracks.
- Select audio/video/subtitle tracks per file or in batch.
- Export tracks with preserved metadata.

### 2. Merge
- Build batch merge pipelines for episodes or full seasons.
- Attach external subtitle/audio tracks.
- Auto-match by episode naming patterns.
- Configure language/title/default/forced/delay per track.

### 3. Audio to Subs
- Transcribe audio/video to subtitles with Deepgram.
- Manage multiple transcription versions.
- Batch process and export SRT/VTT/TXT.

### 4. Video OCR
- Extract burned-in subtitles from video frames.
- Use a global OCR region for all files with per-file override when needed.
- Review OCR versions and export subtitles.

### 5. AI Translation
- Translate subtitle files with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or OpenRouter.
- Multi-file queue with progress and batch splitting.
- Keep formatting and subtitle timing structure.

### 6. Rename
- Rule-based bulk rename/copy workflows.
- Preview results, detect conflicts, then execute safely.

### 7. Info
- Quick media inspection for container, tracks, codecs, bitrate, and metadata.
